What devices can you control using this app? 
- You can control any IR device in this world .....Yes Thats True!

Requirements:
- Arduino Board (UNO, MEGA, Leonardo, Nano, Pro).
- Infrared LED.
- Infrared Receiver.
- Bluetooth BLE Module or Shield.
- Arduino Sketch(URL provided inside the app).

Instructions:
- This is a DIY solution.
- Upload Arduino Code to your Arduino Board.
- Wire the bluetooth module as per the diagram in the app.
- Connect your IR LED to Pin 3 for Uno,Leonardo.
- Connect your IR LED to Pin 9 for Mega.
- Connect your IR Receiver to Pin 11 for Uno,Leonardo, Mega, etc.
- Open the app then connect to your Arduino using Bluetooth.
- Enable IR Receiver from the app setting tab.
- Bring any remote that you want to hack.
- Start sending command to Arduino and see the magic!

Tested on iOS with:
